```haskell
solve :: [Int] -> Int -> Int -> Int
```
- Basic explanation:
    - `solve` is the name of our function
    - The content after the `::` refers to the type of the function. In our case, our function takes an **array of integers**
    - Every arrow represents a function, being everything on it's right the function returns
    - There is no special distinction between the parameters and the return type
    - The return type is the last item in the declaration, and the parameters are the first three
    
- Functions type declarations are completely optional. If you are not sure on what yours should be, leave it blank!
