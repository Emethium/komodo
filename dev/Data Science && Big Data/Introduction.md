## Types of Big Data

1. Structured
    - Any data we can store, process and access
    - Data format is known beforehand
    - Obvious example is any data stored in a database

2. Unstructured
   - Any data of unknown structure
   - Can contain a mix of text files, videos and images
   - Example: the output of a Google Search

3. Semi-structured
    - Contains both of the above forms of data
    - Most of the time the data is defined, but not structured
    - Has information which contains organizational properties but they are not in the traditional database format (all transactional data, maybe?)
    - Example: any data on a XML format

## The Three V's of Big Data

1. Volume
    - The data volume is crucial as it gives an idea about how to extract value of the data
    - For a certain data set to be called **Big** data, it depends entirely of the volume itself
    - High volumes of low-density data will be processed

2. Velocity
    - Refers to the speed at which the data is generated
    - Includes both the recieving and the actions performed on the data
    - Big Data deal with how quickly the data flows in and from what sources
    - The stream of generated data is unprecedented and massive

3. Variety
    - Meaning different types of data: structured, unstructured, numeric, audio, text, images, video, documents, etc
    - Also means that different ways to mine, store and analyze each type of data must exist.
