# Pattern Matching

## The Match Operator

- In Elixir, the `=` operator is actually a match operator, comparable to the equals sign in algebra

- So, if the match succeeds, it returns the value of the equation. Otherwise, an error is thrown

```ex
iex> x = 1
1

iex> 1 = x
1
iex> 2 = x
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: 1
```

- The same idea applies to all Elixir's data types

- It should be fairly obvious now, but the match operator performs an assignment when the left-handed operator includes a variable.

## The Pin Operator

- In contrast to the Match Operator, the Pin one does not allow variable rebinding

- When we pin a variable, we match on the already existent content rather than rebinding a new one

```ex
iex> x = 1
1

iex> ^x = 2
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: 2

iex> {x, ^x} = {2, 1}
{2, 1}

iex> x
2
```

- Elixir 1.2 introduced support for pins in map keys and function clauses:

```ex
# Map keys
iex> key = "hello"
"hello"

iex> %{^key => value} = %{"hello" => "world"}
%{"hello" => "world"}

iex> value
"world"

# Function clauses
iex> greeting = "Hello"
"Hello"

iex> greet = fn
...>   (^greeting, name) -> "Hi #{name}"
...>   (greeting, name) -> "#{greeting}, #{name}"
...> end

iex> greet.("Hello", "Sean")
"Hi Sean"
```
