# Basic Operations

## Arithmetic

- Elixir supports the basic arithmetic operators `+`, `-` `*` and `/`

- The `/` operator **will always return a float**

- If you need integer division remainder, make use of the `div` and `rem` functions:

```ex
iex> div(10, 5)
2

iex> rem(10, 3)
1
```

## Boolean

- Elixir provides the `||`, `&&` and `!` boolean operators, that supports any data type:

```ex
iex> -20 || true
-20

iex> false || 42
42

iex> 42 && true
true

iex> 42 && nil
nil

iex> !42
false

iex> !false
true
```

- There are also three more operators, but they require **the first argument to be a boolean** to work:

```ex
iex> true and 42
42

iex> false or true
true

iex> not false
true
```

## Comparison

- Elixir provides us with all the common comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`, `<=`, `>=`, `<`, and `>`

- For strict comparisons, use `===`

- Two different types can be compared, which can prove useful on sort operations.

## String Interpolation

- It's seems to be identical to Ruby (obvious reasons implied)

```ex
iex> name = "John"
iex> "Hello #{name}"
"Hello John"
```

## String Concatenation

```ex
iex> name = "John"
iex> "Hello" <> name
"Hello John"
```
