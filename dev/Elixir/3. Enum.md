# Enum

- Module that includes functionalities for working with enumerables
  - All collections, for the exception of tuples, are enumerables

## `all?`

- Can be used with one or two arguments

- When using `all?/2` (a.k.a with two arguments) we should supply a function to apply to the given collection's items
  - It's not a regular `map` function, if you thought that. The return is either `true` or `false`
  - In a sense, we're checking if **all** the elements in a collection passes (or not) in a specific function check
    - Which reminds me of the `AND` logical operation between function outputs

```ex
iex> Enum.all?(["foo", "bar"], fn(e) -> String.length(e) == 3 end)
true
```

## `any?`

- Similar to the abovementioned `any?/2`, but will return `true` **if at least one item** evaluates to `true`
  - Which reminds me of the `OR` logical operation between function outputs

```ex
iex> Enum.any?(["foo", "bar", "baaz"], fn(e) -> String.length(e) == 3 end)
true
```

## `chunk_every`

- Used to break a collection into smaller chunks

- It was a little tricky for me to get this at first, but let's take a look at the function definition:
  
  ```ex
  chunk_every(enumerable, count, step, leftover \\ [])
  ```
  
  - `enumerable` is, of course, our enumerable/collection
  
  - `count` here is the size of each chunk

  - `step` is the offset, between collection's items, to be applied when generating the chunk's combination. For example:

    ```ex
    iex> Enum.chunk_every([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2, 1)
    [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6]]
    ```

    - We asked for two-element chunks combination, with a offset of one element between them, sequencially

    ```ex
    iex> Enum.chunk_every([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2, 2)
    [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
    ```

    - We asked for two-element chunks combination, with a offset of two elements between them, sequencially
  
  - `leftover` collection to be used to complete partial chunks

    - If :discard is given in leftover, the last chunk is discarded unless it has exactly count elements

## `chunk_by`

- Groups a collection by a function application similarity

```ex
iex> Enum.chunk_by(["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"], fn(x) -> String.length(x) end)
[["one", "two"], ["three"], ["four", "five"]]

iex> Enum.chunk_by(["one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"], fn(x) -> String.length(x) end)
[["one", "two"], ["three"], ["four", "five"], ["six"]]
```

## `map_every`

- Classic `map` function with a twist

- Applies a function collection's elements following a step offset:

```ex
# Apply function every three items
iex> Enum.map_every([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 3, fn x -> x + 1000 end)
[1001, 2, 3, 1004, 5, 6, 1007, 8]
```

## `each`

- Iterates over a collection without producing new values

```ex
iex> Enum.each(["one", "two", "three"], fn(s) -> IO.puts(s) end)
one
two
three
:ok
```

## `map`

- Classic `map` function

- Applies a function to every collection item, producing a new collection in return

```ex
iex> Enum.map([0, 1, 2, 3], fn(x) -> x - 1 end)
[-1, 0, 1, 2]
```

## `min`

- Finds the minimal value in the collection

- Works for multiple data types and mixed data type collections

```ex
iex> Enum.min([5, 3, 0, -1])
-1
```

## `max`

- Same behaviour as the `min` function, but returns the maximum value instead

## `filter`

- Filters a collection to include only the elements that evaluaate to `true`, according the given function

```ex
iex> Enum.filter([1, 2, 3, 4], fn(x) -> rem(x, 2) == 0 end)
[2, 4]
```

## `reduce`

- Classic `reduce` function

- Reduces our collection to a single value by applying, cumulatively, a function for every single item

- If no accumulator is provided, the first enumerable element is used

```ex
iex> Enum.reduce([1, 2, 3], 10, fn(x, acc) -> x + acc end)
16

iex> Enum.reduce([1, 2, 3], fn(x, acc) -> x + acc end)
6
```

## `sort`

- I guess that does not need a "what is this?" explanation

- `sort/1` uses Erlang's term ordering to determine the sorting order:
  
  ```ex
  iex> Enum.sort([5, 6, 1, 3, -1, 4])
  [-1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]

  iex> Enum.sort([:foo, "bar", Enum, -1, 4])
  [-1, 4, Enum, :foo, "bar"]
  ```

- `sort/2` allows to pass a custom sorting function:

  ```ex
  iex> Enum.sort([%{:val => 4}, %{:val => 1}], fn(x, y) -> x[:val] > y[:val] end)
  [%{val: 4}, %{val: 1}]
  ```

## `uniq`

- Can be used to remove duplicates from enumerables

```ex
iex> Enum.uniq([1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
[1, 2, 3]
```

## `uniq_by`

- Also removes duplicates, but by the use of a custom function to compare the uniqueness

```ex
iex> Enum.uniq_by([%{x: 1, y: 1}, %{x: 2, y: 1}, %{x: 3, y: 3}], fn coord -> coord.y end)
[%{x: 1, y: 1}, %{x: 3, y: 3}]
```
