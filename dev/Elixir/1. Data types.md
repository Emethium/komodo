# Basic Data Types

## Integer

- Just what you would expect.

- Bult in support for binary, octal and hexadecimal numbers:

```ex
iex> 0b0110
6

iex> 0o644
420

iex> 0x1F
31
```

## Float

- 64-bit double precision numbers

- Supports `e` for exponencial values

```ex
iex> 3.14
3.14

iex> 1.0e-10
1.0e-10
```

## Boolean

- Again, just what you would expect

- Everything is truthy except for `false` and `nil`

```ex
iex> true
true

iex> false
false
```

## Atom

- Constant whose name is it's value

- Identical to Ruby Symbols, which I should be familiar with

- `true` and `false` also correspond to the atoms `:true` and `:false` respectively

```ex
iex> :foo
:foo

iex> :foo == :bar
false

iex> :true == true
true
```

- Modules names are also considered atoms

- Erlang modules references are also modules:

```ex
iex> :crypto.strong_rand_bytes 3
<<23, 104, 108>>
```

## String

- UTF-8 encoded

- Wrapped in double quotes

- Supports line breaks and escape sequences

```ex
iex> "Hello World!"
"Hello World!"

iex> "Hello"
```

## List

- Multi-type collection of values

- Implemented as linked lists. To prepend is faster than to append

```ex
iex> list = [3.14, :pie, "Apple"]
[3.14, :pie, "Apple"]

# Prepending (fast)
iex> ["π" | list]
["π", 3.14, :pie, "Apple"]

# Appending (slow)
iex> list ++ ["Cherry"]
[3.14, :pie, "Apple", "Cherry"]
```

### Concatenation

```ex
iex> [1, 2] ++ [3, 4, 5]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Subtraction

- When dealing with **duplicated** values, for every element on the right list, only **the first occurence** will be removed

- Subtraction uses **strict comparison** to match values between elements

```ex
iex> ["foo", :bar, 42] -- [42, "bar"]
["foo", :bar]

iex> [1,2,2,3,2,3] -- [1,2,3,2]
[2, 3]

iex> [2] -- [2.0]
[2]
```

### Head/Tail

- Common functional languages patters. You remember this from Haskell.

- Elixir provides us with two operators: `hd` and `tl`

- You can also use **pattern matching** to split a list's head and tail

```ex
iex> hd [3.14, :pie, "Apple"]
3.14

iex> tl [3.14, :pie, "Apple"]
[:pie, "Apple"]

iex> [head | tail] = [3.14, :pie, "Apple"]
[3.14, :pie, "Apple"]
```

## Tuples

- Similar to lists, but stored contiguosly in memory

- This makes modification expensive, since a tuple is stored in it's entirety on memory

- You're probably going to make use of Lists when dealing with highly mutable data.

```ex
iex> {3.14, :pie, "Apple"}
{3.14, :pie, "Apple"}
```

- Tuples are commonly used as a mechanism for returning additional information from functions

```ex
iex> File.read("path/to/existing/file")
{:ok, "... contents ..."}
```

## Keyword lists

- Associative collection, but different from a regular Map (see below)

- Special list of **two-element tuples** whose first element is an atom

- As performant **as a List**

```ex
iex> [foo: "bar", hello: "world"]
[foo: "bar", hello: "world"]

iex> [{:foo, "bar"}, {:hello, "world"}]
[foo: "bar", hello: "world"]
```

> As you can see, they are tuples even if you don't need to explicitly quote them as such

- The three main characteristics of Keyword lists are:
  - Keys are atoms
  - Keys are ordered
  - Keys do not have to be unique

- As such, keyword lists are most commonly used to **pass options to functions**

## Maps

- Elixir key to value store

- Unlike Keyword Lists, the allow keys of any type and are not ordered

```ex
iex> map = %{:foo => "bar", "hello" => :world}
%{:foo => "bar", "hello" => :world}

iex> map[:foo]
"bar"

iex> map["hello"]
:world
```

- Variables can be used as map keys directly:

```ex
iex> key = "hello"
"hello"

iex> %{key => "world"}
%{"hello" => "world"}
```

- On the case of a Map field duplication, the last will replace the former one:

```ex
iex> %{:foo => "bar", :foo => "hello world"}
%{foo: "hello world"}
```

- Also, there is a special flavor for atom keys, slightly different than the original, and can be accessed in a also different way:

```ex
map = %{foo: "bar", hello: "world"}
%{foo: "bar", hello: "world"}

iex> map.hello
"world"
```

> Similar of your run-of-the-mill JavaScript JSON object notation

- Maps also have their unique notation when updating an already-existent map key: (which creates a new Map, fiy)

```ex
iex> map = %{foo: "bar", hello: "world"}
%{foo: "bar", hello: "world"}

iex> %{map | foo: "baz"}
%{foo: "baz", hello: "world"}
```
