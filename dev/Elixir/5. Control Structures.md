# Control Structures

## `if` and `unless`

- If you are familiar with Ruby, it's the same thing

```ex
iex> if String.valid?("Hello") do
...>   "Valid string!"
...> else
...>   "Invalid string."
...> end
"Valid string!"

iex> unless is_integer("hello") do
...>   "Not an Int"
...> end
"Not an Int"
```

## `case`

- If it's necessary to match against multiple values, we have `case/2` at our disposal

- `_` represents the default case

```ex
iex> case :even do
...>   :odd -> "Odd"
...>   _ -> "Not Odd"
...> end
"Not Odd"

iex> case {:ok, "Hello World"} do
...>   {:ok, result} -> result
...>   {:error} -> "Uh oh!"
...>   _ -> "Catch all"
...> end
"Hello World"
```

- Since `case/2` relies on pattern matching, all rules and restrictions also apply here.

- If you need to match against already existent variables, you need the `^/1` operator:

```ex
iex> pie = 3.14
 3.14

iex> case "cherry pie" do
...>   ^pie -> "Not so tasty"
...>   pie -> "I bet #{pie} is tasty"
...> end
"I bet cherry pie is tasty"
```

- `case/2` also supports guard clauses:

```ex
iex> case {1, 2, 3} do
...>   {1, x, 3} when x > 0 ->
...>     "Will match"
...>   _ ->
...>     "Won't match"
...> end
"Will match"
```

## `cond`

- Used when we need to match conditions rather than values

- Akin to `else if`/`elif` in other languages

```ex
iex> cond do
...>   2 + 2 == 5 ->
...>     "This will not be true"
...>   2 * 2 == 3 ->
...>     "Nor this"
...>   1 + 1 == 2 ->
...>     "But this will"
...> end
"But this will"
```

- `cond/1` will raise an error if there is no match. We can define a `true` condition to deal with this:

```ex
iex> cond do
...>   7 + 1 == 0 -> "Incorrect"
...>   true -> "Catch all"
...> end
"Catch all"
```
